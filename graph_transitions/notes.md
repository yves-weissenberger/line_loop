#Notes

This just contains some notes on things to do and random questions that are relevant to the experiment to be logged



## RL models

What groups of RL models do we envision are being applied to solving this task

1. Simple Model free learning
2. Stupid Habitual behavior based on (physical) proximity to GOAL
3. Stupid Habitual behavior based on (physical) proximity to current state
4. SR learner
	4.1. Default representation
5. Multiple policy maps
6. Full model based control
	6.1 What algorithm learns the world model?
